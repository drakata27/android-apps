these are the lecture exercises covered in the lectures.

To run the exercises properly, make sure to copy colors.xml and string.xml content under values\ and relevant xml file.

The Rating bar exercise includes a theme which should be under values\themes\themes.xml

and finally, if the java file content is changed, this is going to be visible to you in MainActivity.java.

Good luck.
