To run the customized toast message exercise, please follow the following steps:


1. create a layout under res\layout. You can do this by right clicking on the layout folder then select NEW > Layout Resource File
2. name your custom layout as toast_custom
3. delete the auto-generated code, and copy - paste the code given in toast_custom.txt
4. activity_main code is also given which is using a frame layout and a button. You can either copy - paste this, or create it from scratch.
5. finally mainActivity.java code is given in mainActivity.txt. Here the custom layout is inflated to the toast message.
6. As an additional option, you can customize the colors. The colors I used are shared in colors.txt


GOOD LUCK.
